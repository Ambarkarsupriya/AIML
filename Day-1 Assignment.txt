Machine Learning
                Machine learning is type of Artificial Intelligence which enables self learning from data and 
                processes the learned data  without human brain or human involvment.
                The primary aim is to allow computers to learn automatically without human involvment.
                ML learns from data and perfoms a task and gain some experience and 
                again performs same task which provides better accuray results.
Machine learning provides statistical tools to learn from data.
Statistical tools are mainly classified into 3 types:
                        1-Supervised learning
                        2-unsupervised learning
                        3-Re inforcement learning
Example for Machine learning:
        Medical analysis:
                        ML can be used in medcial analysis.
                        prediction of the disease based on the previous test results which  informs earlier about the disease.
                        Based on the information provided by machine we can also plan a theraph for the disease.
         This Medical analysis can be used in Health sectors.
conclusion 
            Machine learning applications are one of the ways through which technology can improve our lives.
